# Skills Hub

Skills Hub is a virtual skill sharing platform. Users who want to share their talents can create a profile and post their shareable skills for hire while users looking for help with a job or chore can categorically search for service offerings, read/post reviews and contact skill sharers about rendering their services. Skills shared can vary from aesthetic services and personal training to home repair offerings and mechanic services. Lastly, Skills Hub users will be asked to rate and review the skill that has been shared with them.

#### Users

Skills Hub is for skilled people who are looking to provide their services for money. The application provides a platform that connects people with others who are skilled and offering corresponding needs to their own. 

#### Example

Skilled user, Dima, is looking to make some spare cash by cleaning cars and advertises on his profile that car detailing is a skill he would like to share. User Maggie has a car but no time to clean it. Maggie goes on Skills Hub and searches “car detailing” and finds Dima’s profile because he lives near her and his rate is reasonable. Maggie reaches out to Dima through the application and they arrange a time for Dima to clean Maggie’s car. 

#### Why Choose Skills Hub?

Skills Hub differentiates itself by eliminating the sale of things (as you might see on websites like Kijiji and Craigslist) and specifically helps its users sell their skills and services. The rate and review options helps users - both providing and purchasing - to make an informed choice when choosing a skill sharer.
